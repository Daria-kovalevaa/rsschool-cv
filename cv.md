## Brief Self-Introduction:
*Currently I'm styding at MSMU, and supposed to be a dentist, but I feel like it's not my cup of tea. So I'm on my way to change my life and to reach new goals as a front-end developer. My core strengths are that I'm openminded, up to new ideas and easy to learn new skills.*
## My skills:
* *HTML*
* *CSS*
* *Basic JavaScript*
* *Git (remote service GitHub)*
## Code examples:

``` 
function separateTypes(input) {
    const result = {}; 
    for (let index = 0; index < input.length; index++) {
        const type = typeof(input[index]);
        if (!result[type]) {
            result[type] = [];
        }
        result[type].push(input[index]);
    }

    return result; 
}
```
